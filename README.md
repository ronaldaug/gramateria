# Gramateria - v1.0.6 

Gramateria a drag and drop web builder which is built with GrapesJS but with a different look, blocks and components. And v1.0.6 is using Bootstrap 5, can generate a Desktop app with ElectronJS and can deploy to Netlify.

----

Gramateria v1.0.6 is a re-rewritten version that changed many features and code.

> Although I have stopped developing this app for a while, there are still many users and I feel a little bad because of my old/dirty codes. So I decided to refactor the codes and add some features to be more useful for developers and non-developers in this v1.0.6.


## Installation 

```npm install```

```npm start```

#### Generate sources
```npm run gen```

#### Watch sources
```npm run watch```


##### Build desktop app
```npm run pack```

### v1.0.6 Change logs

- Change electron-packager to electron-builder
- Change Materialize CSS to Bootstrap 5
- Upgrade Grapesjs to v0.17.19 (latest version)
- Added Nelify deployment
- Messy codes to modular code
- Added laravel mix for script compling 
- Added new blocks
- Add Notyf for toast messages
- Remove Gapesjs export plugin 
- Remove dashboard version in v1.0.4 which was built with vue.js, element UI and firebase. [reason of removing dashboard](#remove-message)


#### Reason of removing dashboard
<a name="remove-message"></a>
Because making Gramateria to compatible with Vue, ElementUI and Firebase versions is not an easy task for me. And I want to keep Gramateria as a desktop based app.

#### Roadmap
- Add more blocks
- Make it available for linux and window. 
- Add more SEO tags
- Build multiple pages
